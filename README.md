Llama Media will help promote your business to people who come to Llama Land.
Advertisers would sponsor llama coins, and then llama users could earn a small amount of llama coins by watching ads. 

### Rulesï¼š
1. We will charge 10 Llama Coins per day as a handling fee. For example, Advertising period is 5 days, the fee is 50 llama coins. (If the sponsorship fee is less than the transaction fee, the ad placement will fail, and the corresponding tokens will be refunded to the sponsor.)
2. We will select a random integer between the minimum and maximum values to determine the number of tokens a user receives when claiming.
3. If the advertising cycle ends and the sponsorship fees have not been fully claimed by users, the remaining amount will be refunded to the sponsor.
4. If the sponsorship fees have already been fully claimed, any remaining users who attempt to claim will not receive tokens. (But if the advertisement you place is attractive enough, I believe people will be willing to come and view it.)
5. The number of Llama Media Worker NPC is limited. If there is no free Llama Media Worker NPC, please sponsor next time.
6. Claim is only for the user who is vouched.
